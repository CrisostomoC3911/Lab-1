#### Experience

> I previously intern'd as a **Software Development Lead** for the San Diego Supercomputer Center during the summer. During that time, I created a mobile app that manages a household's work allocation paired with a real time chat using **_React Native, Firebase, and Node.js_**. I am continuing this internship throughout the fall as well!

#### About Me

```
 I am a senior student who grew up as an engineer and developed a passion for programming.
 I love finding creative solutions and working in a team, and I am seeking a career in Backend/Full-stack Software Development.
 In my free time, I am a serial hobbyist. I am an avid long-time Dungeons and Dragons Game Master. I play all sorts of video games ranging
 from but not exclusive to MOBAs, MMOs, RPGs, Fighting Games, and Roguelikes. I Iove playing guitar and I've recently gotten into the
 kalimba and melodica. I am also a rabid consumer of far too many movies, tv shows, Fantasy/Sci-Fi novels, mangas/manhuas/manhwas, web
 novels, and history. I am a big foodie, and I love to cook and bake in my spare time! I am also very interested in learning new languages;
 I am currently only fluent in English/Tagalog/Spanish, but I plan on becoming fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,
 and French!
